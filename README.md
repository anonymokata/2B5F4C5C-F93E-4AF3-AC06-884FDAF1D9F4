Greetings reviewer of my code!

I have revised my code according to the helpful feedback I have received!

Since you certainly already know the rules of the game I will keep this simple for you!

(1) clone this repository

(2) 'make' to just make the library

(3) 'make check' to make the library and run the tests!

I hope that you sincerely consider me as a candidate!
